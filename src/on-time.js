/**
 * Create crontime with various combinations of month, week, weekdays, hours, minutes and tick.
 * Only time is a mandatory parameter. All crontime expressions are set according to this time parameter.
 * The crontime expression that will be triggered before the entered date according to the tick value is returned.
 * If only the month(0..11) and week(0,1,2,-1) parameter is filled, the crontime expression that will be triggered every day from the first day of the week to the last day of that week is returned.
 * If only the month(0..11), week(0,1,2,-1) and weekdays(0..6) parameters are populated, the crontime expression for that day is returned.
 * If only the week(0,1,2,-1) parameter is populated, the crontime expression that will be triggered every day during that week is returned. Except last week(-1).
 * If only the month(0..11) parameter is populated, the crontime expression is returned for each day in that month.
 * If only the weekdays(0..6) parameter is populated, the crontime expression is returned for this weekdays every month.
 * If only the month(0..11) and weekdays(0..6) parameters are populated, the crontime expression is returned for these weekdays of this month.
 * If no parameters are filled in, the crontime expression is returned for each day of each month.
 * 
 * @param {Array} args Options. Month(0..11) for crontime expression. Week(0,1,2,-1) for crontime expression. Weekdays(0..6) for crontime expression. Time(hh:mm) for crontime expression. The number of days to subtract from the date. Month and week required parameters for tick.
 * @param {String|..M} args.month Month for crontime expression. It takes values between 0 and 11. It takes value <digit>M.
 * @param {String|..W} args.week Week for crontime expression. It takes values 0, 1, 2 and -1. It takes value <digit>W.
 * @param {String|..WD} args.weekDays Weekdays for crontime expression. It takes values between 0 and 6. It takes value <digit>WD.
 * @param {String|hh:dd} args.time Time(dd:mm) for crontime expression.
 * @param {Number} args.tick The number of days to subtract from the date.
 * @param {String|..FD} args.firstDayOfWeek First day of week. It takes values between 0 and 6. It takes value <digit>FD.
 * 
 * @returns {String} Crontime.
